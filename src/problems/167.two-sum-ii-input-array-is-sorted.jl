# 
# Given an array of integers that is already **_sorted in ascending order_** ,
# find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# 
# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they
# add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
#   * You may assume that each input would have _exactly_ one solution and you may not use the _same_ element twice.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
#     Output: [1,2]
#     Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
#     Output: [1,3]
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
#     Output: [1,2]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
#   * `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
#   * `nums` is sorted in **increasing order**.
#   * `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
#
