# 
# Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array
# of characters `char[]`.
# 
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying
# the input array  [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-
# place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.
# 
# You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii
# characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
#     Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
#     Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
#
